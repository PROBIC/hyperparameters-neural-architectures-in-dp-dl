# Hyperparameters and neural architectures in differentially private deep learning

This repository contains the code to the master thesis *Hyperparameters and neural architectures in differentially private deep learning* by Marlon Tobaben at the University of Helsinki.

The code requires access to the benchmark library by [Harutyunyan et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0103-9) and to the [MIMIC-III database](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/). Some code fragments might come be similar to the library by [Harutyunyan et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0103-9).

In order to run the code, some adjustments to the enviroment might be necessary.
